Lightweight, resource saving and GDPR compliant WP statistics.

== Description ==

This plugin observes incoming traffic and logs page views and visitors.

Lightweight (200KB) and resource-efficient.
Backend CPU footprint: <1 ms.
Frontend CPU footprint:  <1 ms.

- Requires jQuery in the frontend to bypass page cache plugins.
- No configuration required.
- IP addresses are obfuscated after processing, so it is very GDPR safe.
- Optimized DB design and data types guarantee for the lowest storage usage (32 bytes per IP log entry, so roughly 1GB per 31 million distinctiv visits).
- Advanced minimal logging only adds an average of 1 ms to page load time.
- Super fast Internal IP2GEO location database for IP resolution (2.5MB).
